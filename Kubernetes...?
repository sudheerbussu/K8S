Kubernetes
------------------------

Google created this kubernetes.
It is a opensource tool.
Pre-requisite is docker.

k8s  -- 8 letters between  k  and  s

It is a container orchestration tool.
 
Kubernetes creates cluster, deploy and manage clusters.

By using kubernetes we form a cluster
K8S schedules, runs and managers isolated containers.

Convert isolated containers running on different hardwares into a cluster.

In AWS we have a service EKS  ( Elastic kuberneters service )

Features of kubernetes
---------------------------------
1) Orchestration (  clustering any no of containers on different hardwares)
2) Auto scaling
3) Auto healing ( new containers in place of crashed containers 
                              similar to handling failover scenarios in docker swarm )
4) load balancing
5) rollback  ( going to previous versions )


Kubernetes Architecture
-------------------------------

Cluster is combination of 1 master and multiple nodes.

Pod is atomic unit of deployment in kubernetes.

Pod consists of one or more tightly coupled docker containers.

Pod runs on node.
Node is controlled by Kubernets master


Kubernetes does not understand containers.
Kubernetes can understand only pods.


In this diagram , we have one master and one node.
node is also called minion.
Kubernetes master is also called as control plane.

Dockerswarm    ---------------------------->  Docker
Kubernetes   ------------------------------- Docker  / XYZ



Master contains 4 components/ services
1) kube api server
2) kube scheduler
3) controller manager ( acutal state = desired state )
4) ectd  



As a devops engineer  you create a yaml file  ( .yml )   file 


What this yaml file contains?

1) No of nodes you want?
2) Each node should have  how many pods
3) Each pod should contain  how many containers


All the above information will be available in yaml file.
This file is also called manifest file.

This document should be provided to kuberneted master.

+++++++++
kube api server acts like a receptionist.
It receives the yaml file and pass the request to kube scheduler.

++++++++
kube scheduler will take the action.
So kube scheduler will create pods and containers.

++++++++

What is etcd?
Etcd is also called cluster store.
It has the information of the complete cluster.
It is used to store the data of master, node and containers.
Data is stored in key-value pair.

+++++++++++
What is controller manager?
It is responsibile to make sure that the actual state is same as desired state.

These four components together called as control plane.

Kubernetes node
---------------

Node container 3 components
1) kubelet
2) kube-proxy
3) container engine

Kubelet  -- is also called as agent, as it listenes to kubernetes master.
                   kube-scheduler  component communicates to  kubelet.

	kubelet  communicates to container engine ( docker ) so that containers
                 are created. 
                Note: Containers are created in pods

kube proxy  -- 
	It will provide IP Address to pod.

Kubernetes commands starts with  
  kubectl   --  if the cluster is in single cloud.
  kudeadm --  on premise
  kubefed  -- federated ( multiple clouds   ex:  aws + azure )
